            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <img id = "mainimg" src = "images/mitski2.jpeg" alt = "A black and white photo of Mitski for a promotional shoot" title="Mitski on a promotional shoot">
            <p cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitski"><b>Mitski Miyawaki</b>, known professionally as <i>Mitski</i>, born Mitsuki Laycock, was born on September 27, 1990 in the <i>Mie</i> prefecture of Japan. Before settling in the United States, <b>Mitski</b> lived in thirteen countries, including (but not limited to) China, Malaysia, Turkey, and the Democratic Republic of Congo. She refers to herself as "half Japanese, half American but not fully either." While attending Purchase College's Conservatory of Music to study studio composition, Mitski self-released her first two albums, <i>Lush (2012)</i> and <i>Retired from Sad, New Career in Business (2013)</i>. Her senior project at Purchase originally involved the creation of these albums. <i>Bury Me at Makeout Creek</i>, her third studio album, was made available in 2014 via Double Double Whammy after she graduated. Her critically acclaimed albums <i>Puberty 2 (2016)</i>, <i>Be the Cowboy (2018)</i>, and <i>Laurel Hell (2022)</i>, the latter of which reached the top ten in multiple countries, were then published when she signed with Dead Oceans in 2015. She was named the "best young songwriter" in America by The Guardian.</p>
            <p>Before graduating from SUNY Purchase in 2013, <i>Miyawaki</i> released her first two albums using the school’s resources, including a 60-piece student orchestra featured on her second project. <i>Lush (2012)</i> and <i>Retired from Sad, New Career in Business (2013)</i> were released in <i>Mitski’s</i> junior and senior years as end of term projects. Both albums were self-released by <i>Mitski</i> herself via Bandcamp.</p>

                <q cite="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/482375750#:~:text=MIYAWAKI%3A%20I%20don't%20think,ecstasy%20can't%20last%20forever.">I don't think I'm alone in this: I'm obsessed with trying to not only be happy but maintain happiness, but my definition of happiness is skewed more towards ecstasy rather than contentment.</q>
